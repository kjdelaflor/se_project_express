# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Project Description

The what to wear project helps users wear based on location and weather condition of that location. These are of course recommendations. The back end includes as of sprint 12 the ability to create clothings items, get all items, delete items, like an item, and dislike an item.This specific projfects is a back end usage with applications such as:
Mongoose
nodemon
ESLint
Prettier
Postman
Node.js
Express.js
MongoDB
MongoDBCompass.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
